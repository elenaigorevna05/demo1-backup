Oh, it seemed forever stopped today
All the lonely hearts in London
Caught a plane and flew away
And all the best women are married
All the handsome men are gay
You feel deprived

Yeah, are you questioning your size?
Is there a tumor in your humor
Are there bags under your eyes?
Do you leave dents where you sit

When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

Oh, what are you really looking for?
Another partner in your life
To abuse and to adore?
Is it lovey dovey stuff
Do you need a bit of rough?
Get on your knees
