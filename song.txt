When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

Oh, what are you really looking for?
Another partner in your life
To abuse and to adore?
Is it lovey dovey stuff
Do you need a bit of rough?
Get on your knees
